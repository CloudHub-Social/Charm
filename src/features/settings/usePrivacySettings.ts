// second snapshot include the first change, but that's only a client-side
// guarantee. Both IPC calls are still independently in flight, and if the
// older one's request reaches/acquires Rust's `PRIVACY_PREFS_LOCK` *after*
// the newer one, its stale full snapshot gets saved last, silently
// dropping whatever the newer toggle added. Serializing here — queuing
// each write behind the previous one's settlement, not just its start —
// means the second IPC call can never begin (and so can never finish)
// before the first one already has, so persisted writes land in the same

// different one logs in) while a write is still queued behind an earlier
// one, that queued write would otherwise execute against the new account,
// saving the old account's full settings snapshot (and forcing its
// `appear_offline` choice) onto it. Bumping this on logout makes every
// write enqueued before that point a no-op once its turn comes, instead of

// the earlier one would blindly overwrite that newer snapshot with its
// own (now-stale) settings, and a subsequent toggle reading the cache in
// `usePatchPrivacySettings` would then send yet another full snapshot
// that silently drops the still-in-flight newer change. Module-level (not
// a `useRef`) so it stays correct even if more than one component
// happened to call `useSetPrivacySettings`/`usePatchPrivacySettings` at

  // settings snapshot into the cache — right after `queryClient.clear()`
